Linear Algebra for Java: http://mikiobraun.github.io/jblas/

# The library is in the "sample" folder
# I have added some prob images in the "probs" folder

=> The application loads the library and does all the necessary calculations on launch
   (This may delay launch depending on the computer's performance)

The "Face Library" tab
----------------------

# Lists all the faces in the library (from the "sample" folder)


The "Average Face" tab
--------------------

# Displays the average face


The "Eigen Faces" tab
---------------------

# Lists the selected eigen faces (I have seleceted Eigen faces that has the highest Eigen values)


Searching for a face
--------------------

# To select a prob face go to "File->Select Image"
# When an image is selected the results will be displayed in the "Results" tab.
  (The Results tab is dynamically created when an image is provided)

=> In the Results tab faces in the library are displayed from left to right 
   from the most likely match to least likely match.

 Four possible Results
 =====================

 1. A face from the library
 2. Not a face
 3. Looks like face
 4. A new face
